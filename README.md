## CS4240 Interaction Design for VR / AR (Assignment 2)

**How to play:**

This is a simple carnival shooting game. The goal is to hit all 3 targets with a pickup item (rods on the floor).

---

**Controls:**

In VR, you can look around to observe your surroundings.

Movement is tied to teleporting and you can only teleport to the locations of the 4 yellow poles in the game. Simply aim at any one of the yellow poles and click on the left mouse button to teleport there.

To pick up an item (grey rods on the floor around you), aim at the object and it will turn yellow. Click on the screen with your left mouse button to pick it up. Click on the screen with your left mouse button again while holding the item to throw it.

When each target is hit by the item that you threw, it will disappear and you will gain a point. 

Earn 3 points to win the game!

You may restart the game anytime by aiming at the "Retry" signboard somewhere on your right (the sign is quite big).

**Downloaded Packages:**

These were the downloaded assets used in my game:

- VRBox Unity package to control game objects in VR.

All other interactive game objects were either modelled / scripted by me.
